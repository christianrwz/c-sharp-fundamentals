## Object-Oriented Programming

### Encapsulation
* Encapsulation refers to bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class. 

* It also involves restricting access to certain components, often by making attributes private and providing public getter and setter methods to access or modify them. This protects the internal state of an object from unintended or harmful changes.

* **Note**: For implementation please refer to the sample code located in the src/OopPrinciples/Encapsulation folder for reference.
