## Object-Oriented Programming

### Abstraction
* **Abstraction** is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object or system.
   
* It simplifies interaction with the system by providing a clear interface for the user without exposing all the internal workings.

* **Note**: For implementation please refer to the sample code located in the src/OopPrinciples/Abstraction folder for reference.
