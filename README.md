## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**

### Inheritance

- **Inheritance** allows one class (the subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors (methods) of another class (the superclass). It helps promote code reuse and establishes a hierarchy between classes.

- A subclass can also override or extend the behavior of the superclass.

- **Note**: For an implementation reference, check the sample code in the OopPrinciples/inheritance folder.
