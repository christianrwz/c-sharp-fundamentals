## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles**

### Polymorphism

- **Polymorphism** means the ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way. This allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

- It can be achieved via method overriding (runtime polymorphism) or method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

- **Note**: For an implementation reference, check the sample code in the OopPrinciples/polymorphism folder.
